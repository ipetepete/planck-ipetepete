## Changes over default

### Space+FN

I added a function layer accessed by holding down space, this gives me the arrow keys under my right hand without having to move.

I also added the container characters (parens, brackets, braces) to the center column which makes quick access via the function layer.

Some other optimizations were done on the function layer to assist in programming, most of the symbols are accessible on the left hand.

### Mod Shift Keys

Inspired by Space Cadet Shift, a single tap of LShift will produce a `$`. RShift will produce a `'`, this makes programing much easier for these common characters especially since my muscle memory already associates the `'` key with my pinky, this is a much easier transition.

### Hyper FTW!
The first key to the right of the Raise key acts as a hyper key wich allows me to have some custom shortcuts using [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net), such as Hyper+S (opens Safari), Hyper+E (opens Spacemacs), Hyper+z (puts the display to sleep).

### Tap dancing caps lock

Tap Esc twice to engage caps lock. Useful if you ever do any SQL.

## Future work

I'm going to add some rgb under lighting, along with an arduino controller plugged in to the computer and a software interface that will allow me to coordinate some monitor back lighting with the underglow of the keyboard....just need to wire things up, proof of concept is already working.
